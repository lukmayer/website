# Repository for lukmayer.github.io

This is the code for my personal website.

It uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

I have written a few posts about how I built this website. 
You may want to read them if you are new to Quarto:

- [Basics](https://lukmayer.github.io/blog/posts/quarto.html)
- [Template](https://lukmayer.github.io/blog/posts/quarto_template.html)
- [Updating](https://lukmayer.github.io/blog/posts/fast_quarto.html)
- [Login portals](https://lukmayer.github.io/blog/posts/login.html)

You can use the code in this repository to build your own website, but only if you also open-source it.
