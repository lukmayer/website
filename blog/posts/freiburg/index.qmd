I grew up in South-West Germany, but in my 13 years there I never visited some cities of my state of Baden-Württemberg.
That's why my sister and I decided to make a day trip to Freiburg im Breisgau, the only major city in the Black Forest region.
Since I was home for the holidays, we took the first best chance to do the 2.5h drive after Christmas.
Unfortunately, this timing does imply that we did not get to see what Freiburg is like at maximum Christmas.
Despite that, I was pretty impressed with the city and its surroundings!
I'm obviously used to the aesthetics of more traditional German cities[^1], but Freiburg has an impressively large and beautiful old-town for its modest size (Population: approx 200k).
It's also remarkably close to nature.

[^1]: Berlin differs significantly from the "German city recipe".

Here's a little photo diary of the trip :)

## Road trip to Freiburg

Once we really started to get outside the Stuttgart metropolitan area, temperatures dropped (from -1°C to -8°C) and the landscape became very snowy.

We also saw lots of old traditional houses typical to the far south of Germany.

We also drove past this huge 240m tall tower (500+ ft), which sticks out like a sore thumb in the otherwise rural landscape.

There is also this very cliffy area on the way.

## Freiburg old town

As I mentioned, the old town of Freiburg is fairly extensive.
It's also quite ornamented, with lots of little details on the buildings.

\

The large cathedral (Münster) can be seen from almost anywhere in the old town.

\

The entire core is mostly devoid of cars, with trams, bikes and good old feet being the main modes of transport.

Also note that trams can pass through both openings of the gate.

:::

\

![](images/mini_bächle.jpg)

::: text-center
Many streets in the center are lined with these water channels called "Bächle" (lit. "little creek").
They are a unique feature of Freiburg, and a major tripping hazard.
Unfortunately they seem to be devoid of water in the winter.
The cobbled sidewalks also tend to have mosaic patterns built-in (see top left).

## The Münster and Münsterplatz

The Münster is the main cathedral of Freiburg and is located on the Münsterplatz.
The square is also home to the market.
The Münsterplatz is a very lively place, even in the cold.
It also has a lot of interesting buildings around it.

The Christmas trees are still up.

## Schlossberg

The city has its personal hill, the Schlossberg, which offers a nice nature-getaway right in the city.
The hill is sufficiently high to offer a good view of the city and the surrounding area.
It also features multiple historical structures and vista points.

\

There are many paths up the hill, but the most convenient way up is to take the Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway.
The entrance to the station is wedged right in between the historical core and a large city park.
The end station on the hill features a restaurant.

\

I actually overcame my fear of heights to take a picture from the tower.
The tower may look pretty sturdy, but it has some noticeable wobble at the top.

Unfortunately, my good deeds were not rewarded, as the extra height made the fog even worse.

## Schauinsland

There is a close by mountain called the Schauinsland, which is a popular destination for hiking, skiing and some attractions.
You can actually reach it with public transport by taking the Tram 2 to its terminal station and then hopping on Bus 21.
In our case it made more sense to just take the car to the foot of the mountain.
You reach the top with a cable car, which takes you up almost 1.3km (0.8 miles) in altitude.

We got lucky and got one for just the two of us.

This was an exceptionally nice day trip.
I don't usually take many pictures, so that should tell you everything.
Of course, we got a little unlucky with the timing and the weather in the city, but it was still an amazing experience.
It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.

Thanks for following along :)
